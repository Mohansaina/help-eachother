2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Run this SQL script:
   ```sql

   -- Add new columns to helpers table
   ALTER TABLE helpers ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bio TEXT;
   ```

### 3. Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your deployed application URL (provided by Render)
2. Test submitting a help request with urgency level
3. Test registering as a helper with a bio
4. Verify that data persists after page refresh
